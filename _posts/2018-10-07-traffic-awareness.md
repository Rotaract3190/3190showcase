ROTARACT VIDYARANYAPURA along with CIVIL DEFENCE Div 13 supported Giftabled- an NGO for disabled kids in creating traffic awareness at Koramangala.

The Kids enacted a mime at every stoplight. We supported them by holding placards and posters and also controlled the traffic for them with the help of Civil Defence & Bangalore City traffic police.This was followed by a bike rally which helped spread the message to a greater majority.
