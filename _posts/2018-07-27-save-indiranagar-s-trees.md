Save Indiranagar's trees was a project that was initiated by Jhatkaa.org to Stop the felling of around 200 trees in Indiranagar for redevelopment of the BDA (Bangalore Development Authority) complex.

Result – They did get a stay order on it.

RBJ helped the organization by volunteering to spread the message far and wide by WoM, Social media and through it’s club members and signing petitions to stop the felling of trees in Indiranagar.
