This year, the Rotaract Club of Bangalore looks to complement the efforts of our parent Rotary Club, in the space of education.
While the mentors focus on creating a brighter future through their Rotary Vidyalayas, we look to add personal, educational and social benefits through the development of soft-skills!

We had a heritage walk for children from migrant labor families. This is an effort to promote our heritage & culture and adopt these kids into our city as our own.
We had 22 School Kids attending this event.

Rotaractors Rtr.Kunal Singh, Rtr.Joseph Wilson, Rtr.Charan, Rtr.Siddharth Ganesh and Rtr.Appu were the official tour guides for the event!

We had a wonderful walk with the kids in and around Cubbon Park, learnt about the History of the statue's of Queen Victoria King Edward, Lt. General Sir Mark Cubbon and Beautiful structures like the High Court, Raj Bhavan, The Govt Museum, The Band Stand etc.

Later we conducted a Quiz on all the things they learnt during this Heritage walk.
