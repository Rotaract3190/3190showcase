Trans Diamond was  5-day long event dedicated to celebrate diversity and be the platform for active citizenship which was  held from 6 – 10, December 2017. 

This was  a confluence of cultural & artistic performances, intellectual discussions and personal conversations to highlight the issues and progress of the transgender community.

It was a unique platform for trans-persons to build career goals and in turn be empowering role models.

Over 100 individuals,  leading transgender activists, political leaders, diversity and inclusion champions, entrepreneurs, business houses, media representatives, grassroots practitioners, LGBTQIA community and the society at large join hands together to host the first international Transgender Festival, "Trans Diamond". 

The team of RCBSW was extremely overwhelmed to be the part of this program and are extremely happy to serve makeroom who took the initiative for this program.
