Most of us end up with no more then five or six people who remember us. 

Teacher's have thousands of people who remember them for rest of their lives. As *RC SBMJC KGF  adopted SVR School in Bangarpet*, we are so happy to celebrate *Teacher's day* in the school along with SVR school children and rotaract club of SBMJC KGF. 

The chief guest for  event were Venkata Raman(Secretary of SVR school), Dr. Rekha Sethi(Principal of SBMJC KGF), Ms.Kavitha(PRO of SVR school), Miss.Padma(Head madan of SVR School). 

It was so happy moment conducting 6 to 7 games for teacher's and distributing the prizes on behalf of rotaract members to the teacher's who won the games.
