Rotaractors Experience @ RYLA - As we walked past the corridor of the Rotary Bangalore Vidyalaya School on a Saturday morning, it reminded us of how we tied our shoe lace and polished our white shoes to every sports drill in school. With a bit of nostalgia and eagerness to interact with the children we started our Ryla Program. 

Emphasizing the need to believe in their dream and the power to think ""I can"" was the aspect of 'I am a winner program'. It is rightly said that  'You yourself need to protect your dreams and don't let anyone curb your interest'. Therefore , a short program was curated to interact with the class, to know their dreams and the steps taken to achieve their goals by developing the characteristics required to achieve their success. There is no better way than to spend a Saturday and we were overwhelmed to see their eyes filled with dreams and their responsibility to achieve them. 

Ryla program is one of the best program that we have attended which helped us to not only spend our day among kids but also to understand that life needs to be indulged with hope, sharing and believing.

Special thanks to Rtn.Meera Mam, RaC Baldwin Women's Methodist College, RaC Presidency College, RaC SSMRV College & RaC Vijaynagar for joining us and making this Project a successful one.
