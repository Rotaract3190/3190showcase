**Indian Army** â€“ When we utter these two words, our heads get down with respect and gratitude to their sacrifice and nobility. 
From the ice terrain of Himalaya to the scorching heat of desert, they guard us as their family day and night without complaining.

As a tribute to Indian Army people and to remember Army's day *RAC SBMJC KGF* in Association with *RAC PES University* organised a event called *Sandesh to Soliders*, where nearly 150 rotaractors have written the letters to Army Personals, thanking them for safeguarding us every second.
