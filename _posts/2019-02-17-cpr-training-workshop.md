Rotaract Bangalore West along with RaC Bangalore South Parade organised a First Aid and CPR-Training Workshop on 17th Feb 2019 at Rotary Bangalore West Auditorium.

CPR ( Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ) is a procedure performed in an emergency when the heart stops,with the goal of prolonging circulatory and lung function.

We along with the support of Vidhi NGO,successfully completed the training where the participants were given knowledge and enlightened about the first action to be taken in emergency situations and how to proceed when an accident occurs. Basic CPR was also thought. It was an hands on CPR session where participants practically witnessed and learnt the procedure. 

The entry fee Rs. 100/- per head.

The participants learnt about the major steps to be taken for sudden cardiac arrests and road accidents,that will certainly help the victims to survive till the advanced treatment arrives.
