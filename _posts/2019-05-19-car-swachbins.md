Rotaract Bangalore Junction partnered with MYM for their Event no. 31- an awareness and community service project "Car Swachbin". With successfully conducted 30 events; distributing 22,000 bins in Bangalore, 65,000 bins across India and they are the official ambassadors of Swach Bharat Abhiyaan.

We distributed 100 eco-friendly, reusable car bins to private car owners to prevent littering on roads. Car owners were appreciative of the idea and forthcoming to contribute for the same.

\
The outcome of the project was fun for all members and some of them even had a breakthrough of being able to make a short conversation with a stranger.



A special mention for Rtn. Siddharth Hamirwasia from Rotary Bangalore Junction for being there and supporting the cause with us. As a part of Swach Bharat Abhiyan we have helped raise awareness about the need for cleanliness and acted upon it by providing them with the car bins.
