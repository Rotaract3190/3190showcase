Rotaract Vidyaranyapura partnered with Rotaract club of Yelahanka to conduct a study tour for the government school kids.

We took 50 government school kids to Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium & Visvesvaraya museum. 

The enthusiastic kids not only had a fun time but also got the opportunity to see and experience the beauty of science that could not be provided with just their text books.
