Rotaract club of Vijaynagar as a community partner along with  Rotaract club of Bangalore South West, Surana College, Indranagar, KS School of Engineering and Bangalore Junction organised a plog run across 50 localities, in collaboration with GO Native, Namma Nimma cycle foundation, United Way Bengaluru and Lets be the change.

Our starting point was Srinagar. All participants got a kit consisting of apron, hand gloves and a bag which was helpful during the plog run.

It was a great initiative to spread awareness about keeping our city clean. 

This initiative has made it to the [world records](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/541225-most-plastic-bottles-collected-for-recycling-in-12-hours){:target="_blank"}.
