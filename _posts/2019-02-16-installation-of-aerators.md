Rotaract Bangalore Junction with Rotary Bangalore Junction conducted first of it's many info sessions with the aim to install faucet aerators in educational institutions and spread awareness about need and importance of water conservation among students.



On 16th of February, the project was executed at Bhavan Press School for students of standard 7th, 8th and 9th; where we have reached out to 162 hands to install aerators. 



Rtr. Harshika Baid presented on the need and importance of water conversation and then demonstrated a live session of installing an aerator in their school premises. 



All students were provided with an aerator each to install the same in their homes. Many Rotaractors and Rotarians attended the session to forward their support. #838moretogo!
