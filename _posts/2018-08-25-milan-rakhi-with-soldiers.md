This project was initiated on the occasion of Rakshabandhan on August 25th,2018. The members of Rotaract Club of Bangalore Southwest visited the **CMP center**. 

The main agenda of this program was to build the feeling of togetherness among every citizen of the country these soldiers who are away from their family will get their family here and the ones whom we invited for this noble cause were the little girls from  Government primary modern school who tied rakhis to the soldiers and with this created a feeling of family far away home.
