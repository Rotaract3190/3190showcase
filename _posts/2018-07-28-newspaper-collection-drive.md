Rotaract Bangalore Junction conducted it's first fundraiser ""The Newspaper collection Drive"" on the 28th and 29th of July 2018.

We collected waste paper by going door to door in four different apartment complexes namely Raheja Residency, SNN Raj Lakeview, Brigade Millenium and Adarsh Palace collectively consisting of 1500 flats. The apartments were picked on the basis of accessibility as each of these apartment complexes has a minimum of one Rotaractor residing. 

We used posters as a form of visual communication to the residents informing them about our drive and received a good response well before the activity. 

We also handed out pamphlets to each house hold illustrating our 6 month plan and verbally educated them about 'Rotaract'. 

It was a tiring task to go door to door, pick up bundles of newspapers - sort and store it, but at the same time a lot of fun.

We had 15 volunteers from our club + 5 non-members who participated in making this activity a success. 

The figures from the collection are as follows:

Raheja  (730kg)  
SNN      (665kg) 
Adarsh  (310kg) 
Brigade (123kg) 

Total = Rs 20,103/-
