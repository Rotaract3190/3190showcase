This year Is about a million smiles. Any small little deed that we do, knowingly or not, can cause a smile in someone's face. So imagine what we can do if spreading smiles and happiness becomes our motive.

Anywhere you are, Do something to be the reason behind a stranger's smile and capture the biggest smile on their face! 
At the end of the year it'll be so worth it when you realize how many smile you have spread! :)  

Rotaract club of Bangalore SouthWest conducted 'SEWA SANDWICH' ON  `7th August, 2018`, a club activity where all the members came together and prepared simple sandwiches. Those items were donated to underprivileged kids and slums across the slums of KR PURAM.
