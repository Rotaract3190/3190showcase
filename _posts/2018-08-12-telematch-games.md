We at Rotaract Bangalore Junction decided to make the weekly meeting not only about work but also about fun. So on Sunday - 12th August , we held the meeting at Cubbon Park. With its open grounds and fresh air, it was a different and refreshing experience. Followed by the meeting were games where we split up into teams and had to use both physical and mental skills. 

Chocolates were distributed to the winning team, which was followed by a small photo op. All in all it was a fun day which we look forward to doing again. 'Rotaract Club Baldwin Women's Methodist college' joined us in large numbers to making this successful! 

All the participants were divided into 4 teams namely A, B, C & D. 

5 games were played in total. 

- Passing the frisbee
- Three legged race
- Human tic tac toe
- Crocodile race
- Save your water

After a neck to neck competition team B was the winner. It was a fun time for all the members and also a great opportunity to socialise with the members of Rotaract Club of BWMC.
