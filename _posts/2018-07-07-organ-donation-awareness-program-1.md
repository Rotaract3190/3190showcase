Rotaract Bangalore Junction is working towards making people aware about organ donation.

This awareness program was conducted at AARUSHI – The 42nd Installation ceremony of the DRR and Executive Council of RI District 3190. During the club announcement session, Vamshika Ruia (President) spent a few minutes talking to the audience about the awareness program, it’s myths and facts.

Volunteers from the club were present who took on spot registrations. This activity is in association with Organ India, once the registrations forms are filled by the donors they are then couriered to Organ India and Organ India completes the registration with NOTTO and ensures that the donor gets a card with valid registration number.
