On account of Children’s day, an Art Competition was held for School going children of Standard 3 to Standard 10. The information was shared to all the schools in Bangalore with the support of Department of Public Instruction.

Rotaractors and Rotarians have personally approached a total of 80 schools. As a result, about 1800 children from around 100 schools across Bangalore participated in the event. The competition was divided into 4 groups, Group 1 was for 10th and 9th standard children on the first day at 11 am, Group 2 was for 7th & 8th standard children on the first day at 2 pm, Group 3 was for 5th & 6th standard children on the second day at 10 am, Group 4 was for 3rd & 4th standard children on the second day at 1 pm. Each participant was provided with a drawing sheet and a packet of refreshment. Participation certificates were awarded to all the participants. Prizes were awarded separately for each Group including first, second and third prizes along with twenty star performer awards.

About twenty rotaractors from Rotaract Bangalore West and seventy more people from various rotaract clubs and art schools volunteered to make this project a huge success.
