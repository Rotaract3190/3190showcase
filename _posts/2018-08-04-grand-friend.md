Grand Friend is an initiative by Rotaract Bangalore West which was organised on the eve of friendship day by at Sree old age home. The rotaractors of RBW planned to spend quality time with the elderly people and also celebrate friendship day with them.

First a round of introductions happened as an effort to know each other and later we the Rotaractors went to them individually gave them the blankets and few food items were given to them as per their request.

Later the event was followed by a game of chowka bara and we all sang songs together.

In conclusion, both the rotaractors and the people there were on cloud nine after a meaningful and satisfying Friendship Day.
Friendship day in an old-age home.

This year as an extension of this project, we made it as an International Service project where we asked various clubs and individuals to mail or send us a picture with their Grandparents to glorify the bond between them.

We also posted all the entries on our social Media.

We received 33 entries from various Rotaract clubs and Non-Rotaractors.
