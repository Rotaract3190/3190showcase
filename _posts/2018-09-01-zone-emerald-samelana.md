💚 **Zone Emerald Samelana**💚 was successfully organized at GEMS B SCHOOL on 1 November 2018, celebrating _Kannada Rajyotsava_.

The event was conceptualized by _Rtr.Sagar_ and _ZRR Rtr.Krishnarjun_ with some inspiration from the DRR and DRRE.🤩 

The event had **15 clubs** from the district attending this event.

This event was all about learning about the rich heritage of Karnataka and also facilitating of the learning of the Kannada language.🤓📖🖊 

The day started with flag hoisting followed by protocols and zonal meet.🤝 

The first activity of the day was Mad Ads 😍 which was organized by _RC Alliance University in association with Zone Emerald_. All rotaractors were divided into different teams and they had to prepare and present their mad ads within the stipulated time. 🔥 The beauty of the activity was the team mates worked together presented the mad ads mostly in Kannada and even the participants who didn't know the language were delivering Kannada dialogues with proficiency.🤩🤩 

The history of Kannada Rajyotsava was shared with the participants along with few cultural performances. ❤

ZRR Rtr. Krishnarjun took all the participants through the basics of Mobile Filmmaking and Video Editing.📽🎞🎬 The club's were taught the video editing 🎬 so that they could submit their monthly and quarterly reports in the video format which would be more interesting for the viewers. 🤩 

The participants were made to play few games and learn some fun Kannada songs to help them learn the language.🎼🎹 We had some tasty Biriyani ❤ for lunch followed by a very interesting Treasure Hunt organized by _RC GEMS B SCHOOL_ .❤ Immediately after treasure hunt we had movie making competition and the emphasis was on fun with learning even in the post lunch session. We also launched a Professional services project spearheaded by RCK in association with Zone Emerald for Kannada learning which is open for anyone interested to learn spoken Kannada.💚

 The day ended with some valedictory session which included some group singing, dancing and Prize distributions. We also donated 40 food packets to the needy during the course of this event.💚 Overall the Samelana was a memorable event with lots of fun and learning. We thank all the clubs who participated in the event, the EC and DC members the partner clubs(RC Alliance University, RC JNC, RC Koramangla, RC SBMJEC, RC NSOJ) and Host Club Rac Gems B School for being part of this unique initiative and making it a grand success. 🤩
