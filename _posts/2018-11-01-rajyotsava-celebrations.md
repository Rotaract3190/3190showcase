Cultural programmes were organised on Rajyotsava by the parent club, Rotary Bangalore Vidyaranyapura along with \*\*Rotaract Vidyaranyapura\*\* to celebrate Kannada rajyotsava. 

It was a fun filled day where rotaractors and rotarians along with friends and family indulged in various cultural programmes that included games, songs, dances and plays and lots more festivities.

The essence of the day was beautifully captured by the skit performed by rotaractors portraying how similar we are, in our own ways, to the previous generations despite the difference in upbringing.

The skit became a big hit and we were also offered to perform at other events.
