Rotaract Bangalore Vijayanagar in association with PCMC (trust) initiated a unique community service event of correcting  the speech defects caused by Cleft Lip.

This women's day was special for Chikka Hanumamma from a remote village of Kunigal taluk. She is 55yo and was suffering from the cleft lip syndrome by birth. On 8th of March 2019 we Rotaract Bangalore Vijayanagar got Chikka Hanumamma admitted to St.John's hospital, Mysore and she was operated for her condition of Cleft lip.

This condition can be cured and the normal functionalities can be restored through surgery. And, we as an organisation have come forward to help those who are affected by this condition through surgery for free of cost. People who are suffering from this syndrome can approach us and avail the service. No age limit for the surgery.
