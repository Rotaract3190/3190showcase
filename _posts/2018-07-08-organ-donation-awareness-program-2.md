Rotaract Bangalore Junction is working towards making people aware about organ donation.

This awareness program was conducted at the Installation ceremony of our parent club, Rotary Bangalore Junction. During the Community Service Director’s report and plan for the year, he spent a few minutes talking to the audience about the awareness program, it’s myths and facts.

Volunteers from the club were present who took on spot registrations. This activity is in association with Organ India, once the registrations forms are filled by the donors they are then couriered to Organ India and Organ India completes the registration with NOTTO and ensures that the donor gets a card with valid registration number.
