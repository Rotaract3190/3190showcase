Rotary Utsava is a flagship program of Rotary Vidyaranyapura and is also our joint project.



We conducted a walkathon to create awareness about saving water and also had a fire safety drill for the public to make them aware of all hazards that could occur due to negligence or sometimes are purely accidental.



An array of events were conducted throughout the day for residents and schools in and around the locality and were awarded prizes for the same.



We also had a felicitation in the evening to appreciate the Civil Defense teamâ€™s hard work and give them a small token of appreciation, especially for being the first responders of Kodagu Flood and Rescue Operation.



District Governor Rtn Suresh Hari also made his presence and congratulated us for our efforts.



The evening was filled with laughter and fun as we had a show by the famous comedian Krishna Gowda entertaining people of all ages.
