To support the ladies of Rural India we did a joint project with RaC of Delhi Akash, and assisted them with sales of 30 bags of 100pcs each of Diyas. The proceeds from the sales were distributed among the village ladies who resided close to Delhi.

Total amount of funds raised was `INR 15,000/-` out of which `INR 9,000/-` was given as contribution and rest was incurred as  transportation charges from Delhi to Bangalore.

By this project we assisted in lighting many more homes in India this Diwali.
