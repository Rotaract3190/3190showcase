This is one of our projects that has always carried joy and light by each and every one, the
project name says it all. Diwali, the festival of lights, we visit Bosco mane, an orphanage, to
celebrate Diwali by making the children draw rangoli, sing, dance and paint diyas. In the last
we help them in lighting the diyas which they had painted.

We celebrated Diwaglee on 6 th of November 2018. Every year 15 to 20 members join us,
along with them few district heads. This year, we had IPDRR, DRR of 3212 Rtr Ashwin and
rotaractors from different clubs also joined us to celebrate this beautiful festival of lights. To
come to an end of the event we extended our vote of thanks to rotaractors of different
clubs and district and also celebrated our great success of event by lighting the flying
lanterns.
