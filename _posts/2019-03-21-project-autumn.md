"A visit to an old age homes and Orphanages are more sacred than a religious place."

We the *ROTARACT club of SBMJC-KGF* in association with *Rotaract club of OPJU, Sonepat* had a visit to the old age home in parandahalli, nearly 120+ grandparents were there, they just require one consoling word for their hearts & soul...

We the ROTARACT members were so generous in spending our time with them in speaking & listening to them. nearly 35 rotaractors took active part in the event we distributed fruits & biscuits, Cakes to all the grandparents there...
