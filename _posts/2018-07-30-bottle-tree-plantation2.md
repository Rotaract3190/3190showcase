An initiative by Rotaract Club of Ulhasnagar Sapna Garden.

The world need more greenery and less plastic but we got the opposite of what it is required. Hence we make the best use of resources available and cultivate it effectively Supported by *45* Rotaract Clubs all over the world.

In this project we'll plant a sapling inside a bottle and insert that bottle in the wall.

This is known as vertical plantation.

From our club we took part in this wonderful initiative and planted saplings in our homes and in SVR GLOBAL SCHOOL, BANGARPET
