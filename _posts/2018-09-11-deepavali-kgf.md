On the day of deepavali Celebration rotaractors from Rotaract Club of Gems B School had come to KGF. And we celebrated the festival of lights by visiting orphanage for specially abled people, where we spent time by talking to them and playing games with them and also Sharing sweet's and festive food with them.

Later that day we bursted little amount of crackers and enjoyed the rest of the day.
