A pub-g tournament was organised where the participants had to pay Rs. 50 for registration.

The game was played in 3 rounds and the winner of all the rounds received Rs. 200 as the prize.

Along with raising funds, we wanted to spread the awareness that any activity done in limits and in control is not harmful and addiction of anything is bad.
