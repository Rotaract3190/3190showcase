Dandiya Dhamaal v1.6 is a fund raising club service project by Rotaract Bangalore West. We aimed to raise funds for literacy and women and children welfare projects.

The on spot registrations began at 5 PM. The guests were welcomed with lemonade made lovingly by our home club Rotaractors. The Durga Puja followed, along with Garba and Dandiya, which was fuelled by the music of the live band and the liveliness of the dancers.

A flavorful menu of Dhoklas, Fafda and Jalebis were served. Troll cafe graced us with a stall serving snacks and drinks.

After a festive session of nonstop dancing, the event concluded with the Maha Pooja and Aarti, followed by awards for various categories.

RBW thanks Rotaract Club of Presidency College for supporting the event.
