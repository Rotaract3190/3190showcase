Rotaract Club of Presidency College conducted its annual Club Service event ‘Rota-Got Talent’ with the main objective to give a platform to the new Rotaractors to showcase their talent. This time we were glad to get registrations of over 30 Rotaractors with different talents.

The event was judged by Mrs. Prachi Beriwala from the Commerce and Management Department, Mrs. Kavita Rai Sinha from the Center for Media Studies and Ms. Harshini.M from the Department of Computer Applications. We were glad to have our teacher coordinator Mrs. Noreen Alexeena Datta throughout the event.

The genres included dancing, singing, poetry slam, beat-boxing, public speaking, sketching, painting, rapping and photography.

All the Rotaractors were present either participating or encouraging their fellow mates. This marked as a great start indeed and the enthusiasm was incredible.
