National Immunization day was held on the 10th March 2019 across India. Our Government setting out to give two drops of Oral Polio vaccine to every child in our country under the age of five. The Rotary and Rotract Club of Bangalore were keen participants and were put to the task of handling two centres – Manvarthpet Maternity Home in Chikpet and Magadi Road Maternity Centre. 

After a small inauguration (lighting of a lamp) at the Chikpet facility we headed to an auspicious temple where one of the Polio Booths were set up. Post which we volunteered to assist the nurses in giving, marking and keeping a count of the number of young children vaccinated at the centre. 

Our enthusiastic rotractors divided into two teams of three or four set out at different corners of Chikpet carrying the vaccines in an ice box along with a marker and a head count sheet to convince as many parents we could spot to immunize their young toddlers. It was quite a challenge as some children were scared, stubborn and the slightly older ones did throw quite a tantrum. Credit to the well behaved ones as they deserved an extra bite of candy chocolates from our side.

On the streets of busy, bustling, chaotic, commercial Chikpet we were successfully able to vaccinate close to a 100 children. It was quite a relief to some of the parents and they were thankful that we approached them at the right time.

Back at the maternity centre we were able to vaccinate over 300 children and Iam sure numbers continued to soar the rest of the day. This warm sunny Sunday was well spent and extremely satisfying as we all have the same aim in life as many others, to continue and strive to make India a Polio Free Country.
