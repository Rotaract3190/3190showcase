We had a professional development session that was held by a free-lance trainer namely Sanchita. She is a corporate trainee and consultant.

Ms. Sanchita started the session with all members introducing themselves and also adding an adjective to their first letter of their name. The team was then divided into groups and we played some fun team building and leadership activities.

After every activity, based on our results she enlightened us on each and every aspect of working together, being a team with a purpose, many other such key takeaways. Most importantly she made us realise the difference and importance of the word ‘TEAM’ viz ‘Group’.
