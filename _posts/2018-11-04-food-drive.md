Food drive - Gift a meal (Online phase)  is an initiative by Rotaract Bangalore West to spread awareness about the importance of food. 

The first phase of Food Drive was the online phase which was launched on 16th October which was also  “The World Food Day”. We asked various other Rotaract clubs and other organizations to donate a meal to the people who are in need and send us a picture of it. Those pictures were uploaded on our social media handles. We also had facts on “Healthy food” which received a very positive response. There were totally 21 entries from 6 districts and 2000 people were benefited from it.
