I suppose we have a lot of reasons to be happy or bitter in life. But one can hang on that life's filled with different experience and some of us consider to experience among special people. As we welcome our specially challenged children on a Saturday morning to the National Art Gallery we saw children being enthusiastic with their huge smile and arms held out to shake their hands and tell their names. It was surely going to be a memorable experience for each one us. 



Walked past the permanent collection of the museum which brought light to the ancient art and depiction of animals, which was remarkable as children were overwhelmed to identify the animals. As we made our way to look at the finest pieces of art, children was made to sit in front of a huge painting and was given an art kit to spend time to visualise and express their art work. Children portrayed explicit pieces of elusive art works which were filled with imagination and colour. They portrayed their creativity which brought a sense of feeling of accomplishment and overwhelming pride on each of their face. This made us feel that art is the product of creative human expression and bringing a feeling of satisfaction as we saw their achievement.

With this feeling of enjoyment we headed to have lunch. It was that time of the day to bid farewell, but not before they entertained us by singing and dancing. We sat there, delighted and one cannot express the feeling of happiness by watching their beauty of art.
