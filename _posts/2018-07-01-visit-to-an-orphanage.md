Our visit to Elizabeth Charitable Trust was an amazing experience. Praseela, the caretaker and her family provide a loving home to 30 kids between the age group of 6 to 15 yrs. We reached there on a Saturday afternoon, right after the kids got back from school and had their lunch. 

We started off with a drawing competition, in an attempt to interact with the kids. We distributed drawing sheets, crayons, and other drawing materials and asked them to draw whatever they pleased. They drew huts and hills, chaps and choppers. Watching them do it all with so much enthusiasm, gave us a tingling sense of satisfaction. 

We spoke to them about what they like to do and what they wanted to become. I must say, they were one ambitious bunch. Just listening to them talk, made us smile. 

We later distributed some snacks. They all patiently waited till everybody received their share, and once they did, they began to pray in synchronisation. It taught us all to be grateful. 

We provided them with books and other stationery items they required at school. We also distributed bubbles which we were all thrilled to play with. We sang together and had a hearty time.

For a first event, it was perfect. We had a beautiful experience and hope to continue spending more time with them.
