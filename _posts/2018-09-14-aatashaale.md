Rotaract Bangalore Vijayanagar organized a “Toy Drive” from 14th September 2018 to November 14th 2018.

The toys collected will be donated to 45 Anganwadi centres across bangalore which provides care and shelters to kids between the age 3 to 5. When RBV noticed that the toys used by these kids are often broken and they do not have enough toys to play with. Hence, decided to have to provide them recreational toys and educational toys which would enhance their learning capacity and make their learning a fun activity.
