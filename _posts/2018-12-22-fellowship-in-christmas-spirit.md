We had our fellowship meet with christmas theme of Red and Green.



We made our tentative plan of action for next year. We had a member (Rtr. Murtuza) of Rotaract club of Kolkata join the meeting and we had a letterhead exchange with him.



The famous gift exchange game “secret santa” was organised where every member was the secret santa of another member. Everyone was delighted to receive christmas presents.
