Rotaract Bangalore West conducted a RBW Get-together, an opportunity to know and meet every member of the club and to have fun together.

33 members of the club had participated in the event. 

Rtr Sahana Kashyap and Rtr Sushama helped us in organising the "Portrait" game which was a ice breaker.The event  was followed by "Dumb Charades" and Cultural activities like singing and dancing.

On the occasion of Christmas Rtr.Surya Kiran organised "Secret Santa" where each of us received a secret gift from our Santa's.

The event ended up with the "Potluck‚Äù,  which had delicious food cooked and brought from each member.
