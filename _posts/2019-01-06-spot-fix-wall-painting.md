We took a step to make our city beautiful as it was before. In association with an organisation called the ugly Indian we painted the walls of the ITC Windsor Manor underpass. It was a great experience and we all enjoyed it as well.

We also met the mayor Mrs. Gangambike, who was very delighted to see the youth come early on a Sunday morning and do their bit for the city.
