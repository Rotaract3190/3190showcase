Mission Pawssible : Xmas Protocol, a Christmas themed pet adoption drive was successfully conducted by Rotaract Bangalore Junction on the 9th of December in association with Fluffynut at the Domlur Dog Park.

6 pets (5 pups and 1 kitten) found their forever homes while 2 found temporary foster parents. 

In addition to the drive, a pet fancy dress competition was held which saw the most adorable pooches dressed up in Christmas spirit. The prizes were sponsored by PetPals. 

A bake sale was also held, which got completely sold out. The event was also open to everyone else, giving the pet owners a great chance to allow their pets to socialize, and the pet lovers a chance to cuddle and play with the cutest of pups and kitties. 

A special mention to RaCs of Gems B School, Bangalore West & Baldwin Women's Methodist College for being a part of our event. A big shout out to Rtr. Raj Vamshi for promoting our event too. All in all, the park was filled with cheer and laughter, while cuties wobbled their way through it all.
