On the occasion of friendship day we took this opportunity to acknowledge the friends Rotaract has gifted us with.

It was a club service event and the main motive was to get to know our fellow members a little closely.

The menu of the potluck was completely vegetarian and there were many delicious delicacies brought by all our members. The delicacies included Kayi obbattu, Masala vada  and Chutney, Sandwich, Three kinds of sweets, Gobi Manchurian, Puliyogare, Veg Biryani, Noodles, Capsicum Bath, Namkeen, Veg pulao and Raita and Cold drink.

All the members had a great time and great food altogether.
