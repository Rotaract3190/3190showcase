We visited Nightingale Old Age Home in JP Nagar. We put up a movie screening for them and showed them Hindi Medium.

We also served them snacks like popcorn, sandwiches and buttermilk which they actually loved a lot.

During the interval we had a small cake cutting for them and also recorded each of them as they told one best memory of their life.

They were all a true inspiration to us and made us believe the saying that age is just a number and you must be young by heart.
