**Rotaract club of SBMJC-KGF & Asha Beauty Parlour**

Has visited 2 orphanages *Happy home On 4th April* and *Shantinbhavan Krishna Giri on 6th April*

Miss S.Manjula was our hair stylist and with help of Rtr. Indu from RAC SBMJC-KGF have taken a great initiative in giving hair cut for 158 kids for free of cost for both consecutive days. A great work should be appreciated for both of them.

The kids where happier with new look and style and more handsome then they was earlier.
