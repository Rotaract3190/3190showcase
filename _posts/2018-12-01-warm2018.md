Rotaract Bangalore Junction joined Rotaract Club of Alexandria Sporting (Rotaract Clubs of Alexandria and Cairo, District 2451, in Egypt) in their Blanket Drive to distribute 2018 blankets across the world before the end of 2018. 

It is a great unforgettable way for everyone, helping to keep more poor families; adults, children, orphans, elders around the world warmer and happier this Christmas. 

We have collected funds for 100 blankets (165/blanket).

From our Zone â€“ RaC of Bangalore West and RaC of Marthahalli joined us in collecting funds for the drive and together we distributed 150 blankets.
