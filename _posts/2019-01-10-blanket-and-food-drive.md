Rotaract Club of Vidyaranyapura & Rotary Vidyaranyapura with Civil Defence div-13 went around in search of homeless people and makeshift houses where they couldn't afford any warm clothes or blankets and proper food.

We tried our best to give everyone a blanket and some food items which helped them through the cold winter night.

The project was a huge success and encouraged us to hold phase two of the drive a week later.
