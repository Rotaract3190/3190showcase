Blanket Distribution Drive - Helping the homeless in their battle of survival In this freezing December night, the entire city dons their sweaters and rugs ignoring that there are few underprivileged who cannot afford even a blanket - with a roof or a cloth on their bare bodies. 

Rotaract Bangalore Vijayanagar gave them a ray of hope for all those who occupied a little space under the flyover, front space of a closed shop, bus stands and railway stations.

We distributed 15 blankets across Vijayanagar streets and extended the event across yeshwantpur railway station, Basaveshwar nagar Nagarbhavi and Kengeri localities and distributed over 35 blankets.
