A project to touch the heart of indian soldiers who are at the borders fighting for us. Its a small effort from our side to write hand written letters to express our love & gratitude to soldiers.

Rotaract Bangalore Junction along with RaC of Koramangala and other Rotaract Clubs carried out this project.

Our members wanted to make it special, so along with our monthly meeting we all sat together and wrote the letters.
