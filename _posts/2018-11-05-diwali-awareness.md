ROTARACT VIDYARANYAPURA In association with CENTRAL POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD  &  KARNATAKA POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD along with FIRE STATION OFFICERS from Yelahanka Fire Station supported by CIVIL DEFENCE (div 13) did an awareness program at schools in our locality to reduce the use of crackers this Diwali.



The students were enlightened on the harmful effects of crackers, various pollution and its factors and how we as individuals can contribute in reducing  pollution in whatever way we can.



Fire safety measures were explained by the Fire officers, stating the do's & don'ts during a fire accident/emergency. The emergency contact and personal contact numbers were shared in case of any emergency for a quick and better response.



We reached out to nearly 5000 students targeting mainly government school kids. Our posters were put on all school notice boards.
