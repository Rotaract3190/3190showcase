Rotaract Bangalore West conducted its Second Wave of Red Wave, an initiative to create awareness about the menstrual hygiene and taboos attached to it.

> Menstruation is a cycle not a curse, its natural, PERIOD.

We conducted a one week online awareness program where facts about Menstruation were posted on the social media handles of Rotaract Bangalore West.

We had 10 facts each speaking about the taboos and sustainable menstruation methods. It also spoke about Menorrhagia and Premenstrual Syndrome.

We heartily thank Rtn Dr Meenakshi Bharath from Rotary Bangalore West for guiding us throughout and making this successful.
In association with Sukhibhava organization which is run by our PDRR Rtr Sahana Praveen we visited an orphanage called Abalashrama where two trainers from Sukhibhava held  session about,

`“What menstruation is?”, “The Stigmas attached to it” and “Menstrual Hygiene”.`

There were about 78 girls from age 16-25. The session started at 11:00 am and went on upto 2:00 pm.
